                          hyperlink thereto, individual postings on the Service

                          blogs or other personal online media). The Company may
                          limit the amount of postings displayed on or linked to
                          your website. Use of the Service beyond the scope of
                          authorised access as set forth in these Terms
                          immediately terminates any permission or license
